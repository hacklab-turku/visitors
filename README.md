# Visitor logger

Logs visitors in a given network. Can be used to log visits of both
wired and wireless ethernet devices. Useful for person tracking and lab utilization tracking.

Intended to be run on a router. Listens to the journal of `dnsmasq`
for DHCPACKs and stores the visitor database to an SQLite database.

To make this work, you need to reduce DHCP server lease time. We use 5
minutes. There is variable `$merge_window_sec` in `lib/common.php`
which should be at least the lease time but double time reduces
flapping.

The instructions are made for Debian based distributions but should
work with any system running *systemd*.

## Installing

Install requirements (as root):

```sh
apt install php-cli php-sqlite3 php-xml php-curl php-fpm nginx
```

Initialize database:

```sh
./init_db
```

Remember to adjust database privileges to allow writes by user of
*php-fpm* which is `www-data` by default.

Make systemd journal persistent by editing
`/etc/systemd/journald.conf` and making sure that you have the
following option:

	[Journal]
	Storage=persistent

Shorten lease time in `/etc/dnsmasq.conf`. In *dhcp-range* put `5m`
after the range definition. For example:

	dhcp-range=10.0.0.100,10.0.0.254,5m

In the same file, enable logging (a must for this to work):

	log-dhcp

Add access to journals:

	adduser visitors systemd-journal

If you want to serve public parts of the data, let's configure
nginx. Add to nginx server block the following (adapt php-fpm socket
path to your system):

```
location /visitors {
	alias /PATH/TO/visitors/dist;
	try_files $uri $uri/ @extensionless-php;

    rewrite ^/visitors/api/v1/hackbus/(.*) /visitors/api/v1/hackbus?read=$1;

	location ~ \.php$ {
		include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
		fastcgi_pass unix:/run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $request_filename;
	}
}

location @extensionless-php {
	rewrite (.*) $1.php last;
}
```

Reload services (as root):

	service systemd-journald restart
	service dnsmasq reload
	service nginx reload

## Running

First I recommend running this in one-shot mode which processes the
log and exits immediately after processing the last item:

```sh
./follow_dhcp --oneshot
```

Then look in to the database and check if you get senseful data. If
everything is fine, then do a systemd service which runs this
continuously. To run continously, just run it without arguments:

```sh
./follow_dhcp
```

If it works then let's make it persistent. Copy
[example_services/visitors.service](example_services/visitors.service)
to `/etc/systemd/system` and edit path, user, and group to match your
system. Then run:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable visitors
sudo systemctl start visitors
```

TODO instructions for other services like IRC notifier and bot.

## Database

Schema can be found at [schema.sql](schema.sql). Create initial
database with `./init_db`. See some human readable data from SQLite3
console (start with `sqlite3 db/db.sqlite`) by running:

```sql
SELECT mac, datetime(enter, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'),
       datetime(leave, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'), ip, hostname
FROM visit
ORDER BY enter;
```

## Flappiness

Sometimes a user may just pass the premises without staying. WLAN
coverage range might be just a little too broad and the user's mobile
phone picks the wireless network while passing by.

The table *visit* has column *renewals* which counts the number of
DHCP renewals per visit. By default configuration a renewal happens
approximately every 2.5 minutes (5 minute lease time divided by
2). There is also a column *flappiness* in table *user* where
user-specific flappiness can be defined.

By default the flappiness it is zero but on problematic users you can
try magic number of 2 or 3 which usually fixes it. The only side-effect of
having high flappiness is the time period before user is reported to
arrive to the premises. However, in the statistics the arrival time is
calculated from the lease acquisition time so it doesn't break
reports.

### How to set user flappiness

There is no UI support for this feature yet, but it can be done from
the database with the following query:

```sql
UPDATE user SET flappiness=2 WHERE nick='Zouppen';
```

## Other stuff

### Useful queries

Get visitors with name:

```sql
SELECT nick, datetime(enter, 'unixepoch', 'localtime'),
       datetime(leave, 'unixepoch', 'localtime')
FROM visit v
JOIN user_mac USING (mac)
JOIN user u ON (SELECT id
                FROM user_mac m
                WHERE m.mac=v.mac
                ORDER BY changed DESC LIMIT 1
               )=u.id;
```

### Generating oident map

If you want to generate map for oidentd so that connections coming
from local network are identifiable from outside. This allows to get
nicer IRC identities, for example.

	./ident_map | sudo tee /etc/oidentd_masq.conf
	sudo service oidentd reload

However, we never managed to get *oident* to detect masqueraded
connections. This script is just preserved for the sole purpose of
being an example of reading data from the database.

### Cleaning the data

If you have way too many short visits due to misconfigured
`$merge_window_sec` or want to clean up old data by merging short-term
visits (within <10 minutes), there is tool `tools/cleanup_old_data`.

It reads current *visit* table and imports the data into *visit\_new*
while re-evaluating the `$merge_window_sec` for all data on that table.
You should stop `follow_dhcp` while running the tool and rename
*visit\_new* to *visit*. Don't forget to recreate the indices!
